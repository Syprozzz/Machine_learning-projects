# Machine_learning-Algorithms-from-scratch
Stuff i will be doing while learning ml
firstly i implemented a linear regression model from scratch as my first ml model which gave me ideas about learning rate, gradient descent, regression tasks, cost function etc
then i implemented logistic regression which gave me a good idea about classification, binary classification, log loss etc.
then i implemented a basic neural network which predicts based on XOR gate which is a type of logic gate which cannot be solved linearly so hidden layers have to be considered
then finally i implemented a actual neural network also from scratch which predicts breast cancer type(binary classification 1 or 0) from scikit learn dataset.....
